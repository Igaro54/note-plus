# note-plus

!! UNDER DEVELOPEMENT !!

This is basicaly a note app that can go above any window you open!
Are you tired of switching windows again and again from your active work to the notes you really need to work better, faster and stronger?

Here's Note+!

Using a basic interface, a small portion of your screen and some useful shortcuts, you can't be annoyed no more by that Alt+TAB (on the wrong window most frequently) to check up your notes.

This project is open source because of my lack of knowledges to publish it
